<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour
  mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked
  by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are
  sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture,
  or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.
