<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or
  wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then folded around the
  filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings,
  including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese,
  allowing for great versatility and variety. A taco is generally eaten without
  utensils and is often accompanied by garnishes such as salsa, avocado,
  guacamole, cilantro, tomatoes, onions, and lettuce.
